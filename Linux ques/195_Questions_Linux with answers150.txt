        *Incremental Backup: An incremental backup only backs up the data that has changed since the last backup, whether it was a full backup or an incremental                 backup.Incremental backups are smaller and faster compared to full backups, but they require more time and effort to restore data in case of data loss.
        
        *Differential Backup: A differential backup only backs up the data that has changed since the last full backup. This means that the differential backup                  includes all the changes made since the last full backup, even if they were already backed up in previous differential backups. Differential backups are                larger than incremental backups but smaller than full backups.

(192) How will you come to know that there is memory bottlkeneck with the server?
      A) There are several indicators that can suggest a memory bottleneck on a server. Here are some common signs:
         
         High swap usage: If the server is using a lot of swap memory, it may indicate that the physical memory is not enough to handle the current workload.

         High memory usage: If the server is consistently using close to or at maximum memory usage, it may indicate that the server does not have enough physical               memory to handle the workload.

         Slow response time: If the server is experiencing slow response times or applications are running slowly, it may be due to memory constraints.

         OOM (Out Of Memory) errors: If you see "Out of Memory" errors in the system logs, it is a clear indication that the server has run out of physical memory.

         Inability to start new processes: If the server is unable to start new processes or applications due to lack of memory, it may be a sign of a                           memory bottleneck.
